# Apriori Algorithm

Apriori algorithm refers to an algorithm that is used in mining frequent products sets and relevant association rules. Generally, the apriori algorithm operates on a database containing a huge number of transactions.

## Description

•  Consider the transactions data of a retail market attached in the file “retail_dataset.csv”:

-  The file contains 315 transactions.

-  Each row represents a single transaction.

- Each transaction contains a set of purchased items, each one in a separate column.

•	 We need to know if there are any associations between purchased items in a single transaction.

•  Minimum support & minimum confidence are variable as per user input during runtime.

•	Minimum support & minimum confidence should be variable as per user input during runtime.

•	all association rules are generated which can be mined from the transactions and met the minimum support and confidence.

•	The final output of the program display:
1.	The frequent item sets in each candidate before and after removal based on the minimum support count.
2.	The association rules with their confidence.
